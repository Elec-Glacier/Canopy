# What is Canopy?

Canopy is an addon for vanilla Minecraft Bedrock Edition that allows more control over what matters from a technical perspective of the game.

```
Add useful information to your HUD, including light level, TPS, the number of entities in view, 
the inventory of the block or entity in front of you, and more.
Receive a detailed breakdown of the items your farms and machines produce using hopperCounters.
Analyze your builds in slow motion using the tick command.
Create contraptions that load themselves using universalChunkLoading.
... and much, much more!
```

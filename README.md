This pack brings technical informatics, new features, and quality-of-life changes to Minecraft Bedrock Edition, similar to the Carpet Mod for Minecraft: Java Edition.

# What is Canopy?

Canopy is an addon for vanilla Minecraft Bedrock Edition that allows more control over what matters from a technical perspective of the game. With it, you can:

- Add useful information to your HUD, including light level, TPS, the number of entities in view, the inventory of the block or entity in front of you, and more.
- Recieve a detailed breakdown of the items your farms and machines produce using hopperCounters.
- Analyze your builds in slow motion using the tick command.
- much, much more!
